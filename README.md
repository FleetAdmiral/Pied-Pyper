# Pied-Pyper
Auto-install python dependencies without needing a seperate setup file. 
Do keep in mind that this must be used only for personal projects being used on multiple systems and not for projects released to the public. I do not endorse forcing package installations onto users as that entails multiple technical and ethical problems with ok.
